# Mars Exploration App

## Project description
The Mars Exploration App is a web-based platform that combines React for the frontend and a Spring backend, 
following the MVC design pattern. It offers users the choice to create Martian maps or explore existing ones.

## Key Features
**Map Generation:** Users can create detailed Martian maps containing mountains (^), pits (#), minerals (*), 
and water pockets (~). Mountains and pits represent larger terrain elements, while minerals and water are point-like resources, each occupying a single pixel.

**Rover Exploration:** The app includes a sophisticated algorithm for autonomous Martian rover exploration. 
The rover navigates Martian terrain efficiently, actively detecting obstacles, mapping coordinates, and collecting data. 
A detailed log file records the entire exploration process.

The Mars Exploration App provides an immersive experience in planetary exploration, geospatial analysis, and algorithmic problem-solving. 
Whether you're generating maps or overseeing rover missions, this application offers a technically enriching experience in the world of Martian exploration.
